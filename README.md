The empty space, at the horizon of the earth, is visible for a few degrees in the Full-disk images of the imager (AHI) of the Himawari-8 satellite.
This makes it possible that the moon is visible on those images at certain times.
This program allows you to predict the position of the moon in relation to a geostationary satellite and ascertain if there is a visible moon on the images.
The program uses the excelent AA+ v2.47 framework ( http://www.naughter.com/aa.html ) for calculating the exact position of the Moon.
